Don't add me if you play low IQ games like Dota, PUBG, CS. I despise people who have IQ lower than 165 which I believe is the required a mount of IQ to play strategy games. Also if you just want to talk you must prove that you are in fact an intellectual on par with me. I don't share my knowledge with just anyone! You must be worthy XD

If you are triggered because of my superior intelligence, put your comment down below so I can have a laugh at them someday, you plebian.
